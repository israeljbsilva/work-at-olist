# Site's Security
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Clickjacking attacks use layered frames to mislead users into clicking on a different link from
# the one they think they are clicking on. Fortunately, newer browsers support an X-Frame-Options
# header that allows you to limit or prevent the display of your pages within a frame. Valid options
# are “DENY” or “SAMEORIGIN” - the former prevents all framing of your site, and the latter allows
# only sites within the same domain to frame.
# Unless you have a need for frames, your best bet is to set “X-Frame-Options: DENY” – and this is
# what SecurityMiddleware will do for all responses, if the SECURE_FRAME_DENY setting is True.

# For sites that should only be accessed over HTTPS, you can instruct newer browsers to
# refuse to connect to your domain name via an insecure connection (for a given period of time)
# by setting the “Strict-Transport-Security” header. This reduces your exposure to some
# SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
# If set to a non-zero integer value, causes SecurityMiddleware to set the HTTP Strict
# Transport Security header on all responses that do not already have that header.
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/middleware/#http-strict-transport-security

# Additionally, if you set the SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS setting to True, SecurityMiddleware
# will add the includeSubDomains tag to the Strict-Transport-Security header. This is recommended,
# otherwise your site may still be vulnerable via an insecure connection to a subdomain.
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True


# To prevent the browser from guessing the content type, and force it to always use the type
# provided in the Content-Type header, you can pass the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header.
# SecurityMiddleware will do this for all responses if the SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF setting is True.

# To enable the XSS filter in the browser, and force it to always block suspected XSS attacks, you

# responses if the SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER setting is True.
